<p>Gleam's <code>Float</code> type represents numbers that are not integers.</p>
<p>
  Unlike many languages Gleam does not have a <code>NaN</code> or
  <code>Infinity</code> float value.
</p>
<p>
  Gleam's numerical operators are not overloaded, so there are dedicated
  operators for working with floats.
</p>
<p>
  Floats are represented as 64 bit floating point numbers on both Erlang and
  JavaScript runtimes.

  The

    ><code>gleam/float</code></a
  >
  standard library module contains functions for working with floats.
